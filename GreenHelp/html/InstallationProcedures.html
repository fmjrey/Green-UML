<br><br>
<b>System requirements:</b><br>
- Eclipse version 3.4<br>
- GEF(Graphical Editing Framework) 3.4 (While GEF 3.5 is available for download, it is not the latest stable version, and it is known to be incompatible with Green)  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">Get it here.</a><br><br>

<b>Installation through Eclipse update system (Preferred Method): </b><br>
- Starting with the 3.1.0 release of the Green UML Eclipse plugin, installation and updates can be done through eclipse <br>

- Click the check box next to the Update Site and click Install<br>
- Please note that the relationships may have a different version number than the main version of Green. This is normal. The SVG save option will also most likely have a different version number. <br>

- Restart Eclipse and everything should be functioning properly<br>
<br><br>

<b>Installation through file system drop-in: </b><br>
- After downloading the Green zip file, extract the contents to [Eclipse installation directory]\dropins\<br>
- If warned that any existing files with the same name will be overwritten, select "Yes to All"<br>
- The plugins directory should resemble the following<br>

<br><br>

<b>Verifying the installation: </b><br>
- Successful installation of Green can be checked by going to Help -> About Eclipse Platform -> Plug-in Details.  The screen should be similar to this:<br>
<img src="/dbimage.php?id=189259" alt="Plug-in Details window" border="0" /><br>
where the plugins for Green should be listed under University at Buffalo. <br>
- Again, please note that the version numbers of the different elements of the plugin may be different from one another, and this is normal.s\
