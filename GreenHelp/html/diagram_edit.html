<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Display Customizations</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many ways to customize 
  Green's look and feel. This is a comprehensive list of user-changeable settings 
  that will affect various aspects of Green's display.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="BendPoints"><strong>Bendpoints</strong></a><br>
  Bendpoints will allow you to freely manipulate the positioning of your relationship 
  arcs. They can be found by selecting a relation arc and then finding the click- 
  and-drag point in the middle. This is the easiest solution to arcs stacking 
  ontop of each other, and allows for more freedom than Manhattan Routing.</font> 

<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Manhattan Routing<br>
  <img src="img/Routing.jpg" width="349" height="318"> <br>
  Manhattan Routing draws all relationship arcs using horizontal and vertical 
  lines (as opposed to direct shortest path) for a potentially more clean feel. 
  This, however, limits the control the user has over the drawing of arcs as bendpoints 
  cannot be moved. This can lead to problems with arcs stacking on top <br>
  of each other. Manhattan Routing is a setting in Green's <a href="pref_general.html">Preferences</a>.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Relationship Visibility</strong><br>

  In addition to the ability to add or remove relationships completely, Green 
  also allows relationship types to be hidden in diagrams. Visibility settings 
  are not retained after a diagram is closed. Visibility settings also applies 
  to each diagram separately. The visibility toggle can be access via the <a href="context_menus.html">context 
  menu</a>. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Zoom</strong><br>
  Individual diagrams can be zoomed in or out to show desirable portions of the 
  diagram. Zoom can be controlled using the "x" (zoom in) and "z" (zoom out) keys. 
  Additional zoom functions, one to return zoom to 100%, and one to fit entire 
  diagram in the viewable area, can be found in the <a href="context_menus.html">context 
  menus</a>. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Snap to Grid</strong><br>
  The invisible grid snaps type boxes, notes and other diagram elements to a set 
  number of pixels. The default is 1 pixel, effectively disabling the function. 
  It can be changed from the Green's <a href="pref_general.html">Preferences</a>.</font></p>

<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Set to Default/Fixed Size</strong><br>
  A type box's default size is one where all contents are shown. The box's fixed 
  size is a size defined in the <a href="pref_classBoxes.html">fixed size</a> 
  section of the preferences. Both set to default and set to fixed sizes are accessible 
  through the <a href="context_menus.html">context menu</a>, or by using the shortcut 
  key "s." After a type box has been manually resized, the option available will 
  be <em>'Set to Default Size'</em>. When the box is at default size, <em>'Set to 
  Fixed Size'</em> becomes available.</font></p>
<hr>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fully Qualified Type Names</strong><br>
  Type names can either be displayed as simple names or qualified names. Simple 
  names are shown by default. This can be changed in the <a href="pref_classBoxes.html">preferences</a>.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Method Parameter Names</strong><br>
  Names of method parameters can be hidden (displaying only the parameter types) 
  in type boxes. This is a setting in Green's <a href="pref_classBoxes.html">preferences</a>.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Tooltips</strong><br>

  When hovering over a Java element in a diagram, the tooltip will pop up containing 
  the element's JavaDocs, provided one exists. Tooltips can be turned on or off 
  in <a href="pref_classBoxes.html">preferences</a>.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Relationship Subtypes</strong><br>
  If a relationship contains a subtype, the name of the subtype will be placed 
  on the relationship arc. This feature can be turned off in the <a href="pref_general.html">preferences</a>.</font></p>
