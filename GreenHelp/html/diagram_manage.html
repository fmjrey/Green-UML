<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Diagram Management</font></h3>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Creating a New Diagram</strong><br>
  New diagrams can be created in primarily two ways. The first is through Eclipse's 
  File-&gt;New... menu. This option will create an empty diagram in the directory 
  with a name specified. The second is through an element's context menu in the 
  Package Explorer View. This option will create a diagram, and also add the selected 
  element(s) to the new diagram.</font></p>

<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Adding Contents to Diagrams</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>New Types</strong><br>
  New Java types can be created in a diagram using the <a href="overview.html#ModelGeneration">palette 
  tools</a>, Green will generate corresponding Java code in the project.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>New Relationships</strong><br>
  To add relationships to types in the diagram, select one of the <a href="overview.html#RelationGeneration">relationship 
  tools</a>. Then, select the source and target types to create a relationship 
  between them. Green will automatically generate the necessary code to create 
  the selected relationship. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>New Elements</strong><br>
  New elements of types (field or method) can be added through the 'Add Field' / 
  'Add Method' <a href="context_menus.html">context menus</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Notes</strong><br>
  A note can be drawn directly in the editor, and its contents can be changed 
  by double-clicking on it. Notes are saved along with the rest of the contents 
  of the editor. They are selectable and resizable. Their contents are stored 
  only in the diagram file and are not referenced anywhere in the Java code.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Adding Existing Elements</strong><br>
  Exsiting elements can be added to diagrams through the context menus of the 
  specific element in Package Explorer.</font></p>

<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Refactor</strong><br>
  Elements in the diagram can invoke JDT's refactoring commands 'Move,' 'Rename,' 
  and 'Change Method Signature.' These commands are found in the <a href="context_menus.html">'Refactor'</a> 
  submenu of the context menus.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Removing Types</strong><br>
  Types can be removed from a diagram using the 'Backspace' key or the appropriate 
  <a href="context_menus.html">context menu</a> command. This does not change 
  anything in the file system.</font></p>

<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Deleting Elements</strong><br>
  Selectable element (types, methods, fields, relationships, etc.) in a Green 
  diagram can be deleted permanently by using the 'Delete' key. Non-editable Java 
  elements, however, cannot be deleted (e.g. if java.lang.String is in a diagram, 
  it cannot be deleted). <br>
  Warning: Deleted elements CANNOT be restored through 'Undo' (with the exception 
  of Notes, which can be restored).</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Refresh</strong><br>
  To manually refresh the contents of the editor, press the &quot;f&quot; key, 
  or use <a href="context_menus.html">'Refresh Editor'</a> in the context menu.</font></p>

<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Saving Diagrams</strong><br>
  Green diagrams are saved to the directory within the project specified when 
  they are created. However, a 'Save As...' dialog can be brought up to save a diagram 
  elsewhere or as a different format. Green supports several formats for saving 
  its diagrams. The default format is a Green File (extension .grn). Diagrams 
  can also be saved as images using either JPEG (.jpg) or GIF (.gif) formats. 
  To access these formats, change the file type specified in the Save As dialog 
  (how this is done varies across operating systems). 'Save As...' can 
  be accessed through Eclipse's 'File' menu or the diagram's context menu.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Printing Diagrams</strong><br>
  Green supports printing of its diagram. Print can be accessed through Eclipse's 
  File menu or the diagram's context menu.<br>
  Note: Eclipse 3.4, and therefore Green, does not fully support printing in Linux.</font></p>
