<p><font size="-1"><strong>When I try to open a new diagram, Eclipse tells me 
  that "The chosen operation is not currently available." What do I do?</strong></font><strong><font size="-1"></font></strong><font size="-1"><br>
  In order for Green to run properly, it is necessary that you have Java 5 installed 
  and that Java 5 is used to load the Green plugin. <br>
  </font></p>

<p><font size="-1"><strong>How do I save my diagram as a GIF/JPEG image file?</strong><br>
  In the 'Save As...' menu, the dropdown for file type has four options: Green 
  File, GIF, JPEG & PNG. Choosing one of the image options will export your file in 
  that image format. <br>
  Please Note: In order for the Green 'Save As...' menu option to be available, 
  the Green editor window needs to be open. <br>
