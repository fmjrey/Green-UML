<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Open Type in Editor</strong><br>
  Accessing this command through the editor's <a href="context_menus.html">context 
  menu</a> will bring up the 'Select Type' dialog. The user can then choose a type 
  to insert into the current diagram.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Incrementally Explore</strong><br>
  This command is in the <a href="context_menus.html">context menus</a>, also 
  bound to the &quot;i&quot; key. Activating this feature performs a complex operation. 
  First, it looks for all relationships that stem from this type (i.e. this is 
  the source of the relationship, not the target). It then proceeds to look at 
  the targets of those relationships and load them into the editor one-by-one. 
  The relationships between the explored class and its targets are then drawn 
  into the diagram. This will include ALL of the classes, so be wary of using 
  it on very large, complex classes, as the processor load of opening so many classes 
  can me an issue on slower machines. A message window will tell you if the class 
  is fully explored. </font></p>
