<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Philosophy of Green<br>
  </font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Motivation</strong></font> 
<hr>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></p> Green was initially developed to 
support the teaching of software development to beginning Computer Science &amp; 

Engineering students. Having students learn about good software design, especially 
the use of design patterns, was paramount. Without a good sense of design, how 
could a student begin to write code (what would she be coding?) </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pedagogical goal of Green is 
  to focus students on design rather than syntactic details. Green's round-trip 
  capability enables students to move from a high-level design view to a low-level 
  code view at any point in time: the class diagram view and the code view are 
  simply different perspectives on the very same artefact.</font></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></p> Green is a <i>live round-tripping</i> 
editor. It is a <i>round-tripping</i> editor because it allows you to generate 
(Java) code from a UML class diagram, and it also allows you to generate a diagram 
from (Java) code. It is a <i>live</i> round-tripping editor because the diagram 
is updated whenever the code is changed, and vice versa. </font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eclipse project's Graphical Editing 
  Framework (GEF) and its Java Development Tools (JDT) supply much of the framework 
  underlying Green. Green itself provides a UML class diagram model, and extension 
  points for supplying relationship semantics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Green's live round-tripping is accomplished 
  using Eclipse's Java Model and Abstract Syntax Tree, which provide the necessary 
  data structures and tools for live representation of the static structure of 
  Java programs. By focusing on static analysis of code, we have developed a tool 
  that is very good for specific purpose, rather than one that works with all 
  aspects of the software engineering process. The editor features a simple point-and-click 
  interface. Right-clicking in the editor brings up a context menu that includes 
  refactoring and quick fix functionality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Carl Alphonce initiated the Green 
  project at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, in the summer of 2004, with funds 
  generously provided by IBM in the form of an Eclipse Innovation Grant.</font></p>
